      <li>only the most recent 20 messages are stored</li>
      <li>as soon as I restart the server, all messages history is cleared</li>
      <li>because this is hosted on the school wifi, it is not accessible outside of school</li>
      <li>because I am hosting this on my computer, the link is my ip address and is not permanent as it changes when I leave school</li>
